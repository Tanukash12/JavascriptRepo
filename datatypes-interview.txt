Question- Is Js Dynamically type lang or Statistically typed lang?
Ans- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
     You don’t need to declare variable types in JavaScript — the type is decided at runtime, not in advance.
    example: let x = 5;      // x is a number  
             x = "hello";    // now x is a string
