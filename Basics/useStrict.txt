Question: What is "use strict"?
Answer: 
It’s a string literal that tells the JavaScript engine to run the code in Strict Mode, which:
1. Prevents the use of undeclared variables
2. Throws more errors to help you catch bugs
3. Disallows some problematic or outdated syntax

Question:  Why Use It?
Answer:

*Without Strict Mode*	                                                            *With Strict Mode*
Silent errors might go unnoticed	                                        Errors are thrown for better debugging
Variables can be accidentally global	                                    Forces variable declaration with let/const/var
Allows duplicate parameter names	                                        Disallowed in strict mode

Question : Where to Place It?
Answer: At the top of your JS file or function:

Example:

1. "use strict";
function myFunc() {
  // strict mode applies here
}

2. function example() {
  "use strict";
  // Code inside this function runs in strict mode
}

Question:  When NOT to use "use strict"?
Answer: 
When using very old JavaScript code or libraries that don’t follow strict rules (rare case).
In inline scripts where strict mode could break existing behavior (but again, not recommended).

Example: 
"use strict";
x = 5;  // ReferenceError: x is not defined
