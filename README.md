# JavascriptRepo
This repository contains my personal notes, code snippets, and mini projects while learning JavaScript.
From the basics to DOM manipulation and ES6+ concepts â€” everything is structured topic-wise to help with quick revision and practice.
Feel free to explore and learn along with me!
